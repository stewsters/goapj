Goal Oriented Action Planning for Java.


This is a Java port of https://github.com/flags/GOAPy

It is meant to be used from Groovy, but if you don't mind horribly verbose syntax you could use Java.

Tests
=====

There is a version of Flag's <a href="https://github.com/flags/GOAPy/blob/master/example.py">example.py</a> in both Groovy and Java.  
It should also give you a decent idea of how this works.


Build
=====
If you want to export this as a jar, run

gradle jar

and look in build/libs/goapj-${version}.jar
